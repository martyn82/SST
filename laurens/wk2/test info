Testing / checking the triangle-function:

1. Finding out what a Triangle is:

" The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side, a principle known as the triangle inequality. Since the vertices of a triangle are assumed to be non-collinear, it is not possible for the sum of the length of two sides be equal to the length of the third side; nor is it possible for that sum to be less than the length of the third side. "
 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle

Based on this principle, we find that "the sum of two sides always exceeds the length of the third side". This gives us the following tests:
a + b > c | a + c > b | b + c > a

given a = 1, b = 2, c = 2 we get:
1 + 2 > 2 | 1 + 2 > 2 | 2 + 2 > 1
a valid triangle.

When we however sort the list from low to high, we can use the first test only to find out if the other tests hold. Proof:
if min + min > max
then min + max > min (because max > right side min)

This does not prevent us from filling in negative numbers. This however is stupid, because we can't have a negative length or no length. Therefor we conclude that something is a triangle if:
shortest_side > 0 and shortest_side + next_shortest_side > longest_side

2. Testing for an equilateral triangle
check if all sides are of equal length.

3. Testing for a rectangular triangle
check if the pythagoras holds. this requires our sides to be sorted again. But afterwards it's just applying the values to the pythagoras.

4. Testing for an isosceles triangle
check if two sides are equal, but not all sides.
